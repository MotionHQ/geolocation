      <section id="geo-why">
        <h2>Why would you use it?</h2>
        <p>
          Geolocation serves in a multitude of contexts. The government and police use it for security purposes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or ankle bracelets, which — when you think about the fact that neither type of data collection is precise — raises some unsettling implications. But, on the lighter side, some companies use it to change the way we play games by combining it with augmented reality (interacting with virtual elements based on geolocation), like Ingress and Pokémon Go. It opens up the possibility for reviving Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, Where’s Waldo, or even The Oregon Trail.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use geolocation to plot courses, track elevation changes, see location history, find nearby tire shops, tag images on social media, check in to places, get the local weather, etc. We also use it every day to make our lives easier, to interact with other people, to solve problems, to set goals, to track anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geolocation is so much a part of our lives already, and companies are sure to keep harnessing it to improve our online experiences:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A delivery food chain could use it for potential expansion by seeing how many people from a city or region visit its website.
          </li>
          <li>A hospital network could provide its closest emergency room to website visitors based on their locations.
          </li>
          <li>A global company could redirect all country-specific website visitors to country-specific pages.
          </li>
          <li>A city tourism organization could display location-based content depending on where website visitors are in the city.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Whatever the purpose, companies will continue to use geolocation to improve their websites or marketing. As technology improves, the visitor engagement can only increase, making each visit more meaningful and effective than the last, simply based on a little thing like location.
