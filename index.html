        <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <p>Many of the pros of geolocation have been identified in the sections above. Geolocation can be used in a wide variety of contexts to deliver valuable, potentially lifesaving, information quickly and efficiently. Further benefits of geolocation include:</p>
          <h4>Ease of Implementation</h4>
          <p>Anyone can take advantage of geolocation since it only requires that the user setup an HTTP call to an API endpoint.</p>
          <h4>Affordability</h4>
          <p>Many geolocation APIs do come with a fee. However, there are also APIs that leverage open data, with OpenStreetMap, OpenWeather, and Mapbox allowing users to make a pre-determined number of free calls to the API after which charges kick in. 
          </p>
          <h4>Flexibility</h4>
          <p>Geolocation APIs can be accessed on smartphones, PCs, a wide variety of Apple products, and IoT devices. Most modern devices that connect to the internet can take advantage of the benefits of geolocation.

          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <p>As with any technology, benefits must be weighed against potential downsides. Many of geolocation’s benefits can become disadvantages if the technology is used by the wrong people and proper safeguards have not been enacted. The cons of geolocation need to be carefully considered before developers implement its use. Some of the most notable concerns include:</p>
          <h4>Privacy concerns</h4>
          <p>Many smartphone users have no idea how much of their location information is available. Many less sophisticated users may be unaware that they are being tracked at all.</p>
          <p>But location data can reveal sensitive information. Providing useful information all while staying safely within the bounds of legality can be a big challenge.</p>
          <h4>Data breaches</h4>
          <p>Closely related to privacy concerns is the threat of data breaches. With so much information being collected about so many users, any large data breach runs the risk of harming large numbers of unsuspecting uses. </p>
          <h4>Unwanted tracking</h4>   
          <p>There have been instances where users’ location data have been used by stalkers and other malicious actors to locate individuals who may not wish to have been found.. Users may inadvertently be sharing data that makes them less safe, not moreso. </p>   
          <h4>Cost</h4> 
          <p>While it may be cheap to implement a geolocation tool that calls the API a limited number of times, for applications that will be making a large number of calls, the fees can quickly add up. </p>
          <p>Even those APIs that offer free services will start to require subscriptions once calls start to exceed its minimum threshold. If developers are creating an application that will be heavily used, this potential expense should be considered.
