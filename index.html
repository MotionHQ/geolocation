          <h3>Anywhere people want to play</h3>
          <p> In 2016, many people may have never heard the term geolocation, but geolocated games burst onto the scene with the explosive popularity of Pokemon GO. 
          </p>
          <p>Geolocation allows people to embark upon virtual treasures hunts searching for characters that are in placed in the user's location. 
          </p>
          <p>Most, if not all, of these types of games rely on the use of mobile phones, and make use of geotagged locations (or features for which geographical identification metadata has been added). These geotagged locations and then placed inside a map interface with which the player interacts. 
          </p>
          <p>Other games that take advantage of geolocation APIs include Pikmin Bloom, Catan: World Explorers, Minecraft Earth, and Let's Hunt Monsters.

          <h3>Anywhere a package needs to be delivered</h3>
          <p>It is no secret that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, delivery services have become an integral part of most peoples' lives. 
          </p>
          <p>Geolocation is leveraged heavily in the delivery of all sorts of packages.  An armada of Amazon, UPS, FedEx vehicles are engaged in a race against time to deliver all sorts of goods as quickly, safely, and efficiently as possible. 
          </p>
          <p>Geolocation data is used to determine the most efficient routes, and enable drivers to avoid potentially dangerous traffic situations. Geolocation APIs also allow fleet services to collect a wide selection of diagnostics such as mileage, speed, and engine health, thereby limiting downtime per vehicle.

          <h3>Anywhere crowds gather</h3>
          <p>Governments and organisations have long sought to develop tools that prevent and manage emergency situations. 
          </p>
          <p>Crowd rushes, such as the Itaewon disaster in Seoul or the Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster in Indonesia, both in 2022, are a massive concern anytime large crowds gather. Geolocation tools can help identify where crowd numbers are a concern before reaching dangerous levels.</p>
          <p>And in those cases where emergencies are unavoidable, geolocation can be used by first responders to accurately determine the location of incidents and calculate the best routes to save time and lives. 
          </p>
          <p>Geolocation can also be utilised by police to identify patterns and locate hot spots of criminal activity, thereby distributing limited resources more efficiently. </p>
